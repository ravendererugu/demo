The agent for Linux and Windows isn't only for connecting to Azure Monitor. Other services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel rely on the agent and its connected Log Analytics workspace. The agent also supports Azure Automation to host the Hybrid Runbook worker role and other services such as Change Tracking, Update Management, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. For more information about the Hybrid Runbook Worker role, see Azure Automation Hybrid Runbook Worker.
